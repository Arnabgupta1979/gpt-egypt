      <h1>Institutions & Responsibilities</h1>
      <p>
        Seed regulation in Egypt involves several ministries, agencies, research institutes,
        and service providers. This page clarifies who does what, and where to look for more
        detailed information.

        <h2>Ministry of Agriculture & Land Reclamation (MALR)</h2>
        <p>
          MALR provides overall policy direction for the agricultural and seed sectors. It
          issues key decrees, oversees national strategies, and supervises technical
          administrations responsible for variety registration, certification, plant
          quarantine, and extension.
        </p>

        <h2>Central Administration for Seed Certification (CASC)</h2>
        <p>
          CASC plays a central role in the seed system. Its main functions typically include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Coordinating variety registration trials and maintaining the official list of registered varieties.</li>
          <li>Managing seed certification, including field inspection and laboratory testing.</li>
          <li>Conducting market control to verify that seed sold complies with standards and labels.</li>
          <li>Acting as the technical contact point for plant variety protection procedures.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Central Administration for Seed Production (CASP)</h2>
        <p>
          CASP is involved in the production of early-generation and certified seed for
          specific crops, often in collaboration with public breeding programmes and private
          producers. It may operate seed farms, processing facilities, or contractual
          arrangements with growers.
        </p>

        <h2>Central Administration for Plant Quarantine (CAPQ)</h2>
        <p>
          CAPQ is responsible for implementing phytosanitary regulations. For seed users,
          this usually covers:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Issuing import permits and export clearances for seed lots.</li>
          <li>Inspecting shipments at border points and applying quarantine measures when needed.</li>
          <li>Communicating with trading partners and international organisations on plant health issues.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>National Gene Bank (NGB)</h2>
        <p>
          NGB conserves plant genetic resources for food and agriculture, manages ex situ
          collections, and contributes to agreements on access and benefit-sharing. It often
          acts as the focal point for the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for
          Food and Agriculture.
        </p>

        <h2>Research institutes & extension services</h2>
        <p>
          The Agricultural Research Centre (ARC) and its specialised institutes, together
          with extension services, are key for:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Breeding new varieties and providing candidate varieties for testing.</li>
          <li>Participating in variety trials and evaluation networks.</li>
          <li>Advising farmers on the use of certified seed and new varieties.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Other actors such as the Agricultural Bank of Egypt, professional associations, and
          private laboratories also support the seed system through finance, representation,
          and specialised services.
